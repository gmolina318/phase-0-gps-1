1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I was struggling with how to push and pull things from Github.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* I felt I got a lot of clarification on how to work specifically with in Github. The problems I outlined above, were touched on many times. it was helpful to be working out of a repository with a pair rather than just in my own.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* We asked our Guide the fetch and merge commands. My pair and I asked each other many questions throughout to make sure we were on the same page and understanding what the other person was doing.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

* I am confident working within Git locally but still need to continue practicing pushing and pulling to Github. I do not have specific questions at this time, just need to practice.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* My first GPS session went well. I was somewhat confused on how the process would work initially. My guide explained his role and had both of us share our screens. I found this helpful to we could both be working (either driving and looking up answers) and the driver could see the navigators screen as well.
